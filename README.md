# Maze Project Overview

This project involves creating a Maze program that can generate and render mazes and caves, as well as solve them. It covers several important aspects like maze generation, solving algorithms, and additional features such as cave generation and reinforcement learning. The program is implemented in C++ with a GUI and includes several parts, each focusing on different functionalities.

## Contents

1. **Chapter I**  
   Introduction and Background Story.

2. **Chapter II**  
   - **Maze Description:** Explanation of the structure of mazes, including wall representation and how to store mazes in a file.  
   - **Flaws in Mazes:** Describes issues like isolated areas and loops that can occur in mazes.  
   - **Generation using Cellular Automaton:** Details a method for generating caves using a cellular automaton approach.

3. **Chapter III**  
   - **Part 1:** Maze Program Implementation (Render and Load Mazes).
